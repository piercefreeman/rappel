 for @actions only we should support @action(...) as well as @action(...) [Exception: parameters] ...
these parameters include the following: Retry Policies: @action(...) [ValueError: retry: 3, backoff_exp: 2m, timeout: 30s] ... not all args need to be
provided. we can force all arguments to be seconds ... in the db you'll implement timeout as NOW()+timeout, so we can fetch timed out actions, you should
assign a lock_uuid to each runnable action so owners can only update it if they currently own the lock. if an action handler picks up a timed out event via
the SELECT SKIP LOCKED WHERE timeout < NOW() AND existing_filters, then it should be in charge with decrementing the allowable retry count and queuing it for
the future based on the backoff interval. if we receive an explicit action failure as a result, same deal...
